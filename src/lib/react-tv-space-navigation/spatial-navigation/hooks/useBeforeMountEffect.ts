/** This works like a useEffect BUT the effect is NOT run after render.
 * It's NOT run after all DOM mutations either (like a useLayoutEffect would).
 * Instead, it's run synchronously as soon as the hook is called.
 * The cleanup/destructor is also run synchronously, before the effect on a re-render.
 * However, when the component calling the hook unmounts, the cleanup/destructor is run like a regular effect cleanup (during the effect phase).
 *
 * WHY: We want to register Nodes to the SpatialNavigator as soon as they exist. Waiting for the mount/DOM can
 * introduce race conditions and children effects being called before parent effects -> This would result in
 * children Nodes registering before Parent nodes which breaks the SpatialNavigator's tree.
 *
 * @param callback The callback you want to execute before mount. Warning: needs to return a cleanup function.
 *
 * @warning Do not use for anything that is not SpatialNavigator related. It's a bad pattern and should only be used when registering Nodes.
